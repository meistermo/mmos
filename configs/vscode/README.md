This is my config file for visual studio code. It is a fairly minimal configuration. I like to have a lot of screen space when I am coding so I've disabled most of the convenience features that take up a lot of space.

### Notable Changes
- I changed the cursor to a more easily detectable underline character _ as I have a hard time tracking the default line cursor and I feel like the block cursor is too distracting.
- I like to work with tab stop whenever possible. This has a number of reasons but I don't feel like disclosing any right now. It is a heated discussion, after all.
- I let the editor close ALL of my opening brackets and quotation marks automatically. This is because I generally find it more annoying when it DOESN'T do it then when it does accidentally.
- I removed the minimap. I can navigate my code pretty well without it and it is visually distracting to me.
- I moved the side bar to the right and keep it closed most of the time. I tend to work on the left side of my screen (probably because I write code from left to right) and I want this space to be as distraction-free as possible.
